# sign-up-form

- Had trouble with getting the logo overlay for a while. This process could use some ironing out.

- Need to find a way to override the default invalid styling when an input box hasn't been touched yet.

- No action on the 'Create Account' button.

- CSS grid would have been nice to know prior to starting this.
